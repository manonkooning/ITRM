General information, describing your project (i.e., the abstract)

This study aims to investigate the factors that influence the decision-making process of English book translators in selecting the vocabulary and grammar for their translations, specifically in choosing between British-English and American-English. To achieve this, the method involves searching for English book translators and examining their work on the Project Gutenberg platform to determine their language preference. The findings of this research could provide insights into the marketability and reception of books in different English-speaking countries, thereby informing publishers, authors, and translators. The hypothesis posits that the choice of vocabulary and grammar depends on the translator's background, education, and familiarity with the target audience. To test this hypothesis, the independent variable is the translator's background, while the dependent variable is the choice of vocabulary and grammar used in translations. Ultimately, this study aims to contribute to a better understanding of the role of language variation in the translation process and ensure that translations are accessible and engaging to readers in various linguistic contexts.

Research question and hypotheses

Research question: Among a subset of English book translators, what factors influence their decision to use either British-English or American-English in their translations?
Hypothesis: The choice of using British-English or American-English in translations depends on the translator's background, education, and familiarity with the target audience. Specifically, I expect that translators from the UK or Commonwealth countries may prefer to use British-English, while those from the US or other English-speaking countries may favor American-English.


Method (including the dataset in use, sampling method etc.)

For this research, a subset of English book translators will be selected from the Project Gutenberg dataset based on their nationality, language proficiency, and the languages they translate. The dataset used in this study comprises books that were originally written in a language other than English, such as French, Italian, Dutch, etc., and have been translated into English. The selection of translators will be determined by examining their biographical information, including place of birth, education, and language proficiency. The metadata of the books will be checked to determine if they have been translated or not. Project Gutenberg provides metadata for each book, including the original language of the book and the language of the translation, if applicable.

I will analyze the selected texts using a Python program that compares the frequency of British-English words to American-English words. I will identify words that have vocabulary-based differences between British-English and American-English, such as "lift" vs. "elevator." To determine the words that have vocabulary-based differences between British-English and American-English, I will consult linguistic resources such as dictionaries, glossaries, and language style guides. I will compile a list of commonly used words in English books and identify the words that have clear differences in spelling, meaning, or usage between British-English and American-English. I will then select a subset of these words to focus on in my analysis. For each translator, I will calculate the ratio of British-English to American-English words used in their translations.

Linguistic resources such as dictionaries, glossaries, and language style guides will be consulted to identify words that have vocabulary-based differences between British-English and American-English, such as "lift" vs. "elevator." A list of commonly used words in English books will be compiled, and words that have clear differences in spelling, meaning, or usage between British-English and American-English will be selected for analysis. The Python program will determine whether a translator prefers to use British-English words or American-English words.

I will then conduct a analysis to determine if the choice of British-English or American-English depends on the translator's background, education, and familiarity with the target audience. Additionally, I will examine whether other factors, such as the genre of the book, the time period in which it was written, or the intended audience, influence the translator's choice of dialect.

The novelty of this study lies in its potential to shed light on the factors that influence the choice of dialect used in translations. The findings may help authors, publishers, and translators better understand the marketability and reception of books in different English-speaking countries. The motivation for this study is to provide insights into the factors that influence the decision-making process of translators in selecting the vocabulary and grammar for their translations. By examining the preference of English book translators in using either British-English or American-English in their translations, this study aims to contribute to a better understanding of the role of language variation in the translation process. The findings of this study have the potential to inform publishers, authors, and translators about the marketability and reception of books in different English-speaking countries, ultimately helping to ensure that translations are accessible and engaging to readers in various linguistic contexts.
