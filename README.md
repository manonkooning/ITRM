Repository for course Introduction to Research Methods


General information, describing your project (i.e., the abstract)

This research investigates the preference of English book translators in using either British-English or American-English in their translations. The study aims to provide insights into the factors that influence the decision-making process of translators in selecting the vocabulary and grammar for their translations. The method involves searching for English book translators and examining their work on the Project Gutenberg to determine if they use British or American English. The significance of this research lies in its potential to inform publishers, authors, and translators about the marketability and reception of books in different English-speaking countries. The hypothesis suggests that the choice of vocabulary and grammar depends on the translator's background, education, and familiarity with the target audience. The independent variable is the translator's background, while the dependent variable is the choice of vocabulary and grammar used in translations.

Research question and hypotheses

Research question: Do English book translators prefer to use British-English or American-English in their work?
Hypothesis: My hypothesis is that the choice of using British-English or American-English in translations depends on the translator's background, education, and familiarity with the target audience. Specifically, I expect that translators from the UK or Commonwealth countries may prefer to use British-English, while those from the US or other English-speaking countries may favor American-English.


Method (including the dataset in use, sampling method etc.)

To conduct my research, I will first search for English book translators and examine their work on Project Gutenberg. After downloading their texts as plain text (UTF-8), I will identify words that have vocabulary-based differences between American English and British English (such as "lift" vs. "elevator"). To analyze the data, I will write a Python program that compares the frequency of American-English words to British-English words and generates a summary to determine which dialect is more frequent in the translators' work.
